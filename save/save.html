                The state is achieved when an object is too focused on one target/goal. If an object gets too one-tracked and stuck in their mind, and has the ability to, they will enter this state.
            </li>
            <li>
                Exists to balance the Inner-Flame.
            </li>
            <li>
                It boosts strength, similar to the inner flame, but rarely helps the object and instead often causes them to hurt others. The objectâ€™s movement speed is greatly decreased.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any object in this state has an impaired ability to think and causes them to focus even more on what caused them to enter the state, which also makes it difficult for them to get back out.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allows the object to walk around underwater without needing to breathe.
